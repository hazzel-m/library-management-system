**Library Management System – SQL-Based Relational Database**

## 📌 Description

This project is a fully structured relational database designed using MySQL. It simulates a real-world library system capable of managing:

- Books and authors
- Book copies and availability
- Members and their loan history
- Reservations for unavailable books
- Fines for late returns
- User roles (admin, librarian, member)
- Action logging (audit trail)

It is ideal for demonstrating database design skills including normalization, foreign key relationships, and real-world business logic.
